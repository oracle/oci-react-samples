# Frontend (ReactJS)

## Introduction

In this lab you will deploy a pre-built ReactJS application locally then build it for production an host it on the Oracle Cloud Infrastucture.

Estimated Lab Time: 15-minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Clone the workshop git repository on your laptop
- Set the API Gateway endpoint
- Run the ReactJS frontend code in Dev Mode then Build for Production
- Host the production build on the Oracle Cloud's object storage

### Understanding the ReactJS application

The application is simple; it uses Functional Components with State Hooks for managing states. There is a main component called "App" which renders another component called "NewItem" and two tables of todo items: the active ones and the already done ones. The "NewItem" component displays the text field to add a new item.

The App component includes the "items" state ([]) which contains the list of todo items. When setItems is called with a new array of items the component will re-render.

The App component also maintains the following states:

- "isLoading" is true when waiting for the backend to return the list of items.We use this state to display a spinning wheel while loading.

- "isInserting" is true when waiting for the backend to process a new insert item. The "Add" button will display a spinning wheel during this time.

- "error" stores the error messages received during the API calls.

The index.css file contains all the styles for the application.

### Prerequisites

**Everything from Prerequisites - Task 2 should be done locally on your laptop**

1. This lab requires the completion of lab 1 and 2

2. You will be using the npm command, make sure it is installed

  ```
  <copy>npm --version</copy>
  ```

  if not please install Node for your laptop, using the following
  link: `https://bit.ly/3evGlEo`.

3. The lab requires also Go lang.

  "go version" -> `go version go1.15.2 darwin/amd64`

  ```
  <copy>go version</copy>
  ```
If not installed, please install Go (see https://golang.org/doc/)

## **Task 1**: Configure API.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. clone again the git repository to a directory on your laptop (we only need the front end in this lab)
  ```
  <copy>git clone https://github.com/peterrsongg/oci-react-samples.git</copy>
  ```

2. cd frontend

3. Run the following npm commands to install the required packages

  ```
  <copy>npm install --save typescript</copy>
  ```
  ```
  <copy>npm install</copy>
  ```
  - In case of errors, try the following command
 ```
 <copy>npm audit fix --force</copy>
 ```
  - Ideally, npm -version should return > 6.14.x AND Node version > 14.16.x
  If npm version < 6.14.x then install the latest Node using
   https://bit.ly/3evGlEo

4. Update API_LIST in API.js

  - Make sure to be in frontend/src directory
 ```
 <copy>cd frontend/src</copy>
 ```
 - In the Cloud console, navigate to **Developer Services > API Management**
 - Click on your Gateway and go to Deployment
 - Copy the Deployment Endpoint
 - Paste the endpoint as the value of API_LIST and append "/todolist"

  Example  
  const API_LIST = 'https://xxxxxxxxxx.apigateway.eu-frankfurt-1.oci.customer-oci.com/todolist';

  - Save the modified API.js file

## **STEP 2**: Run in Dev Mode then Build for Production

1. In the project directory, run the app in the development mode <br />

  ```
  <copy>npm start</copy>
  ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

3. The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
   You will also see any lint errors in the console.

4. Cancel the developer mode execution and build the app for production to the `build` folder. This will create a folder named `build` for you<br />

- Issue "Ctrl-c" to cancel the developer mode executions

- Execute npm run build
  ```
  <copy>npm run build</copy>
  ```
It correctly bundles React in production mode (into the build folder) and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## **STEP 3**: Hosting on the Oracle Cloud's object storage

1. Open up the hamburger menu in the top-left corner of the Console and select
**Object Storage > Object Storage**.

  ![](images/object_store_navigate.png)
    - Create the 'mtdrworkshop' (or another name if that's taken) bucket

  ![](images/create_bucket.png)

  Enter in the bucket details.
  ![](images/bucket_details.png)

  Edit visibility to public

  ![](images/edit_visibility.png)
2. Install the Staci utility for copying directories to OCI object storage
   bucket with folder hierarchies

  - git clone https://github.com/maxjahn/staci.git

  ```
  <copy>git clone https://github.com/maxjahn/staci.git</copy>
  ```

  - cd staci

  ```
  <copy>cd staci</copy>
  ```

  - go get -d

  ```
  <copy>go get -d</copy>
  ```

  - go build

  ```
  <copy>go build</copy>
  ```

3. Upload a static build into the bucket, using the staci binary.
`-source build` should be the path to `build` from `npm run build` earlier. `-target mtdrworkshop` should be the name of the bucket

```
<copy>./staci/staci -source build -target mtdrworkshop</copy>
```

- The application is visible in the 'mtdrworkshop' bucket of your tenancy

- Click on the index.html object and copy the URL of the index object

  ![](images/bucket-index.png " ")

- You may now run the application from Object store, using the URL of the index that you've copied above.
